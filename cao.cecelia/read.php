			<h4>Our Purpose</h4>
			<h2>Decorate Your Daily Life</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 16px">PILE ON PEARLS provides a way for people who want to embrace their femininity and beauty through Eastern spiritual practices and mysticism, for young girls, for daily mix & match, for all kinds of occasions. <br/><br/>The collection is comprised of earings, necklaces, rings and bracelets featuring with pearls or diamonds on most of them. <br/> <br/>The project consisted of developing a potential website to this growing jewelry firm. My main purpose was to promo and online sell with a sleek, simple and easy-to-navigate website</p>

			<h4>About Us</h4>
			<h2>Know More About Our Brand</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 16px">Combining a serif font as headline with a sans serif font as body content is one of the most popular font pairings. This classic pairing has a calming effect on viewers, I would like to make my target audience feel relaxed to choose their favourite jewelry.<br/> <br/>The main color I chose for this website is an elegant light brown, which creates a cozy and relaxed feeling for website visitors. Other than those three basic black and grey colors, this color would be used for some buttons and main position. Also, main color is creating brand. So, just like this brand is creating jewelry for young girls in daily life. This color is very appropriate.</p>
