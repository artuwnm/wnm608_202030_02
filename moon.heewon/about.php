			<h3>Our Story</h3>
			<p>
				$killbank is an e-commerce store where I can sell my skill and knowledge, which I might think is not big of a deal but it could be extremely helpful for someone. I will save my techniques on the website and I will be saving experience related to my major and some pocket money by using them for someone, which is a win-win. There are so many students who are skilled enough but they have a hard time finding the right place to contribute. That is why I came up with this idea.
			</p>
			<p>
				As most of the internships are requiring full time during vacations, it’s hard for students to work during the semester. Also, some ordinary people are in need of workers but not requires experts. For example, someone might be building small storage in their backyard and needs more hands to help him drill nails, move materials and maybe shoveling. These tasks don’t require advanced skills but it could be experienced for architecture major students.

			</p>
			<p>
				How the website works: I will post my 12 skills on $killbank with description about location, available dates, and price it requires per hour. Based on the information, people who need hands will see if the skill and price match and order it.
