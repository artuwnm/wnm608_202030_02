# Contributing

Please be considerate of the following guidelines:
- Install an [EditorConfig plugin][editorconfig] for your text editor/IDE.
- Double quotes, not single.
- Never work in `dist/`, those files are generated by Gulp.
- Make sure to run the unit tests with `npm test`.
- Document what you did with comments in the source and an explanation in the pull request.
