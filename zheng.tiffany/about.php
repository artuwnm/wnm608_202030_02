				<h1>How We Started</h1>
				<p>In the summer of 2018, my friend and I took a vacation to Ojai, CA. The resort at which we stayed was an experience I had only previously imagined angels had the privilege of having. The serenity, peace, and beauty of the mountain scenery stayed with us long after we checked out of the resort. We returned home to Los Angeles, brimming with creativity. We created clothing designs inspired by the flowers and blue skies of that trip. Soon after, we started selling our pieces to friends and friends of friends, and before we knew it, Stylista was born.</p>
